# text-editor

A PWA alternative to Caret.

## Why?

ChromeOS is ending support for Chrome apps, which includes Caret, a popular text editor for developers using ChromeOS. This project aims to provide a supported alternative with improvements.

## Features

- Better syntax highlighting.
- Intellisense for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Typescript.
- Support for opening and saving files using the File System Access API.
- Editor tabs
- File creation

## Features not implemented yet

- Syntax highlighting for more languages
- Custom language support
- Custom themes
- Offline functionality
- Web manifest (PWA support)

## Limitations

- Although the editor is very similar to the VS Code editor, it does not support extensions.
- As this editor is intended to serve as a Caret replacement, support for Firefox and Safari is not planned.
